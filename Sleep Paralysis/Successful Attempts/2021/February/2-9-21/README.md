# Successful Attempt

Today, I had sleep paralysis twice! I woke up naturally within about 5 minutes of when my smart alarm would've gone off. I got up and checked my Fitbit for sleep chart. I didn't have that much deep sleep, but the final chart had almost double what I saw this time. I went back to sleep with a 15 minute timer. I got comfortable and pretended I was taking a nap. Once the timer was up, I definitely went into a trance once it was up. I went back to sleep with a mantra. I just found myself in sleep paralysis not remembering what dream I had before that. I messed with being afraid of waking up but telling myself it won't mess me up. I even tried gently moving my legs. I didn't wake up from it! I didn't cross my eyes until necessary either. I thought I woke up but I ended up in a regular dream. It was kind of scary because I thought my sleep disorder got really bad but it was just a dream. When I woke up, I had an audio hallucination that made me think the fire alarm was going off; it wasn't. It's okay to freak out about negative connotations as long as you stay fairly calm and refer back to your breath, preferably deep breathing. I was going to get up for the day after I didn't fall asleep but I must've fallen asleep within a few minutes of that. I had a dream that eventually collapsed back into sleep paralysis a second time. I woke up within 5 or 10 seconds, but vibrations were much more intense and I had the buzzing feeling in my head especially at the end.
