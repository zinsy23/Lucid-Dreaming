# Successful Attempt

Today was kind of weird. I woke up to check my sleep chart before setting a 10 minute timer to go back to sleep. I fell asleep pretty quickly. I did eventually have sleep paralysis but it felt like I had a bit of dreaming before that. I had sleep paralysis with the buzzing feeling in my head. I tried seeing if it was possible to talk without waking up. I feel like I could do that. I remember not being able to do that. About 30 seconds into it, the vibrations felt like it stopped. I felt like I woke up, except in my bedroom, which I wasn't in in real life. I forgot about that until I eventually woke up in real life. It felt more like I was dreaming about being in sleep paralysis instead of actually being in it. I sort of lost awareness at that point. I gently cross my eyes at that point because I feels like the vibrations come back and decreases my chances of waking up accidentally, but I also keep losing awareness at around that point, so maintain awareness but even more so during that time! It's hard to tell for sure where it happened.
