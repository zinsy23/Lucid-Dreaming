# Successful Attempt

I had sleep paralysis once today. I ended up waking up from it probably around 20-30 seconds into it. It's very possible that I got tricked by when it feels like it stopped. I focused on making sure I had no tension at first. I kept having the negative connotation of waking up by accident. As usual, it went on a little longer than I thought it would given those negative connotations. I think I should have kept paying attention to the tension, especially more when I'm afraid of accidentally waking up! I sort of forgot about the relaxing element too. I should feel extremely relaxed if I'm doing everything right. If I feel like my legs are moving from the vibrations, that's normal and I should let that happen. Towards the end, I was thinking about making sure I don't forget to maintain awareness. I think that's around when I woke up. It felt so vague that I'm surprised I didn't miss when it happened. I noticed I didn't really feel any tingling throughout my body as far as I can remember even after paying attention to it. It was just the pulsing sensation in my head and even that was vague as well. I should keep remembering the big 3: check for tension pretty much constantly, but even more when I'm afraid of waking up; make sure I feel relaxed; and maintain awareness, probably through the sensations and paying attention to how it happens. When I have a false awakening, I probably do the first two. There is a bit of margin, so even if I screw up at a split second, I will probably be in sleep paralysis. I should try to remember that even if it feels like it ended, I should stay still for at least a couple seconds and see if it comes back like it does 30 seconds into it. I remember being in a vague dream and thinking about how I'm waiting to have sleep paralysis. I ended up in it that moment! The dream actually felt like I was watching it more than being in it and that if I concentrated on sleep paralysis, I was pretty much there. I'm going to start going to bed an hour earlier starting tonight. It would allow me to have an extra cycle on days I have to get up a little earlier and maybe even one more on days I can sleep in. I'm really going to try to make it consistent. It will be hard to do that during the weekend when I visit family, but I will really try to keep it close.

I think for now, I will abstain from putting the sleep chart up as I continue to figure out the variation of my method. I'll updated this later describe it more too.
