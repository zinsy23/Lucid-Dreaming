# Sleep Paralysis
Successful attempts

These are the days I had sleep paralysis completely by accident that I remember. In the folders, it is the year, the month within that and then the day. Inside each day, you will find a screenshot of my Fitbit sleep chart that day. There will be annotation of the time I suspected I got sleep paralysis. The time I was awake before that was the cycle I got sleep paralysis. I'll put the lengths in the cycle I suspect I had sleep paralysis. There are also JSON files since you can't see exact timings on screenshots. If you want to practice programming, I would encourage you to create your own sleep chart visualization with JSON file(s).
