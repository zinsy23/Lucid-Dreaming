# Sleep Paralysis
Failed attempts

These are the days I remember attempting to do my method for inducing sleep paralysis, but it didn't work those days. You'll notice on a lot of those days, my deep sleep happened later in the morning instead of earlier. When I attempted, I went in deep sleep, which I suspect screwed me up. I also need to wake my mind up for at least a minute before setting a 10-15 minute timer. If it takes a little to go back to sleep after the timer is up, there's a pretty good I should have sleep paralysis when I go to sleep. There are also JSON files since you can't see exact timings on screenshots. If you want to practice programming, I would encourage you to create your own sleep chart visualization with JSON file(s).
