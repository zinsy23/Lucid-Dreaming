# Lucid Dreaming
Sleep paralysis related stuff will go here.

I failed today. Even though the sleep chart registers a huge chunk of light sleep after 7, my mind wasn't actually asleep. I never fell asleep I think because I was too pressured with how much time I had. I should've done a strategy to help me fall asleep, like lying on my back to build tension then on my side. I was awake since a little after 7 and was tossing and turning a lot.
