# Failed Attempt

I failed today. I was going to do something simple but I was way too tired. I was going to try the alarm thing with a little more emphasis. I'd have a smart alarm, snooze it twice, and keep my mind awake after the second time since I'd probably be fairly close to having sleep paralysis start. I'd focus on breathing as well as the buzzing that happens as sleep paralysis starts. I woke up naturally at around 5:55ish and I knew that I would probably have a little deep sleep after that, so I went back to sleep to try again after. I was right about deep sleep. I don't remember answering the alarm at 7. Clearly, I need more sleep. I think it's preferred to have had a decent amount of light sleep while doing the alarm thing, like November 14th from like 8 until 9:30. Probably not that much but I'd think at least 30 minutes or so. I'm not sure as I haven't successfully tested any further. It'll probably be a little while before I try that again as I'm going to do what I did yesterday for the next couple days at least. If snoozing twice doesn't work, I will try it three times before trying to stay awake and relatively still while focusing on breathing and the buzzing. Hopefully more REM like last Friday!
