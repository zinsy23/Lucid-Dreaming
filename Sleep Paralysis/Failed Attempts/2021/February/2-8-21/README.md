# Lucid Dreaming
Sleep paralysis related stuff will go here.

I failed today. I don't even remember the alarm going off so I can perform the method. I think what happened was I either somehow don't remember stopping the alarms, or when I woke up around 2 in the morning, I shut it off out of habit during that time. Not my alarm for getting up for the day, but the one for performing the method. I had some pretty vivid dreams that day though. I even had one around 2:30 in the morning and remember that kind of being detailed. Can't recall it now but could at the time. Basically, I didn't perform the method, but intended to.
