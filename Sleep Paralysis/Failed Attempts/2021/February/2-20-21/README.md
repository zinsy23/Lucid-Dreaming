# Failed Attempt

I failed today. I tried sort of going back to a method I tried several months ago and combining it with what I've been doing recently. I basically was going to wake up either naturally or alarm, then get in a comfortable position after taking a drink. The idea is that I can get into a trance, but eventually the rollover signal will happen, likely after my mind has dozed. My mind came back as soon as the rollover signal came. I was thinking that if I stayed up and tried not to move, I could potentially enter sleep paralysis. That's what I tried about 5 months ago. Anyway, I would combine that with what I am doing now. I wake up, get a quick drink, spend effort getting comfortable so I eventually snap out of a trance with the rollover signal, then set a 10 minute timer and after that, keep my mind awake by focusing on breathing and paying attention to buzzing in my head. I think I actually fell asleep after getting comfortable and that ruined my chances that day. I should maybe catch up on sleep before thinking about doing that. I have a feeling that it would work. That would be nice because it would very close to the regular method, but a variation and REM could last a bit longer!
