# Failed Attempt

I failed today. I tried doing something I did back in November 14th. I had an alarm, snoozed it once, then entered sleep paralysis right before it went off. Yes, my alarm was actually going off while I was in it. Lots of vibrating. Read my 11-14-20 entry for more information. Anyway, what I tried today was having an alarm, snoozing it basically twice, then not having an alarm for at least a half hour. I set one for 7:30, 7:39, and 8:15. I was hoping that what happened last November would happen again. I woke up naturally a little before it happened. I decided to go to sleep until it actually went off without a smart alarm. I only remember answering the 7:30 one. I should've maybe been more aware of what I was doing. Also, I had woken up directly from deep sleep, so I'm sure that didn't help either. I had a really long light sleep on the day I actually succeeded. I'd say at least wake yourself up a little more like at least be aware of when it's going to go off for the rest of the day and have an idea of which alarm you are answering. I haven't tried again, but hopefully that's what would work. Tomorrow, I'm going to do the 10 minute timer and keeping myself awake at least 10 minutes after like I when I succeeded last Friday. I want to have the sensation of being awake and dreaming at the same time. Be in between and not worry about whether I'm awake or asleep but naturally have awareness of either even if not lucid.
