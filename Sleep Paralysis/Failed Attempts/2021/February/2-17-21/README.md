# Failed Attempt

I failed today. I naturally woke up 10 minutes earlier than the latest my smart alarm would've gone off. I was super tired like I absolutely did NOT want to do this. I'm testing the edge cases, and that includes absolutely not having any energy to do it. Having more energy allows you to naturally do these things that have to be kind of intentional when behind on sleep. I got up and checked the sleep chart. It looked a little better than the past few days with deep sleep, but not bed time. I set a 12 minute timer and don't remember it going off. I was way too tired! I noticed I woke up like a half hour after it should've gone off. Decided to get as much sleep as I could before getting up. I'm super groggy and would rather be sleeping now. Yesterday I was literally a couch potato from around 5:30 P.M (or 17:30) to midnight (0:00). I could've probably stayed up all night if I wanted, but exercise made me sleepy and even grumpy when getting ready for bed wasn't going my way. Clearly the time I went to bed was because of the delay and Murphy's law. Tomorrow I will maybe try a 10 minute timer and wake myself up more after the timer is up. If I miss sleep paralysis, I will try to get it after I've woken up from a dream. We'll also see how well going to bed early with the exercise works.
