Sleep paralysis related stuff will go here.

I failed again today. If you look at the sleep chart, you can see the typical pattern. What could've gone wrong. On the second awake (after the timer), I kept getting into a trance like state even when it showed awake. On the days I'm successful, that only happens once until I'm in sleep paralysis, not around 5 times like today. I woke myself up before starting the timer, but I kept tossing and turning after the timer was up, but I got into a trance multiple times. I should be awake enough for that to not happen. On days that I was successful, you will see I might've had light sleep for around a half-hour, but my mind felt like it was awake for most of it at least. I will try to wake myself more both before and after tomorrow and see what works. It sacrifices my quality of sleep if it doesn't work, but I still want to figure out how to work around that issue instead of doing it like every other day until I get it figured out.
