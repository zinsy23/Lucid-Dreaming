# Lucid Dreaming
Sleep paralysis related stuff will go here.

I failed today. I've been trying to see if I can get the buzzing in my head if I entered a dream while missing sleep paralysis. I did the usual, but I think I missed my first alarm. I was pretty awake and had a hard time falling back to sleep with the timer. I feel like I may have been awake the whole time, but I'm sure I got in a few trances because I wasn't thinking about how I was awake the whole time. After the timer, I still kept tossing and turning and wasn't in the best mood. I eventually had the feeling like I may have had a dream and it would've been the time to try to get the buzzing to happen. I must've forgotten about it very quickly after having that thought. I may not have actually been as awake as I thought. It once again wasn't the best bed time. I'm going to try again and go to bed earlier tonight. I'm going to try exercising and seeing if it really does help me sleep. I'm way off my circadian rhythm and it usually takes a long time to go to sleep during those times. Melatonin didn't really help with that part. It makes me feel even more tired in the morning, but not as much during the night even after an hour or two. I think my active mind was the reason. We'll see if getting really good exercise just before bed will make me able to sleep good even like two hours earlier, if I can finish stuff that has to get done today.
