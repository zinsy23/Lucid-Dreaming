# Failed Attempt

I failed today. Today isn't really worth reporting, so I will keep it short. I ended up going to bed a little earlier. I guess that's worth reporting. I woke up with a smart alarm pretty early. I set another alarm for about an hour so I could try to perform my method. I woke up nearly right away with that one. I used to have deep sleep towards the beginning of the night, but don't anymore. It's now one chunk that essentially happened during the hour alarm. I think it woke me up during REM. I had about another hour before going into my next REM. Unfortunately, my alarm for getting up for the day interrupted my REM again! I could definitely feel it! Hopefully, I will have more REM tomorrow and maybe target things correctly. From the looks of it, it looks like an hour would be good for the first two cycles! I'm starting to notice a pattern again. I'm hoping for better luck tomorrow.
