# Failed Attempt

I technically failed today. I went to bed really late last night and didn't really have hopes as a result. I decided to try at 8 or later anyway. I also happen to try a sleep mask for the first time and it was weird with the scrap, but otherwise comfortable. It doesn't really work well when lying on my side, but I tried it anyway. I think when I lie on my back when going to bed at first, I will try it then until I get into a trance, then take it off for the rest of the night. I will also maybe use it for naps since I'm only in one position. Anyway, regarding the method, I did the 15 minute timer after 8 and didn't succeed after going back to sleep. It looks like I could have because of how short the light sleep was. If I wasn't so tired, I'm sure it would have worked, but I need more sleep. In light sleep, one is supposed to have an easy time waking up, but that definitely depends on how tired a person actually is. If I wasn't as tired, 19 minutes probably would've been enough to witness sleep paralysis if not so tired. I'm really going to try to go to bed earlier tonight if I get my work done. It's really dependent on that. Today probably isn't worth reporting, but that's what happened.
