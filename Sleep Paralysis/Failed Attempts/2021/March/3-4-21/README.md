# Failed Attempt

I failed today. I tried doing the 15 minute timer with a mantra and then a 13 minute timer after a cycle because I would likely be in REM especially if I don't really recall dreams before that. You'll notice a pattern of that in the past two days ago that I would likely have REM then. When I looked at the chart, I didn't have high hopes and was pretty sure I would have deep sleep while attempting. I tried anyway, but still had it. I didn't end up having REM for the rest of the day. That was really disappointing. When doing the 13 minute timer. I woke up before it was up when it had like 39 seconds left. I will try again tomorrow hopefully with earlier deep sleep and more REM. I'm learning a lot of stuff throughout today, so I'll probably have more REM at least. I don't know if there is a correlation, but it would make sense as my mind wasn't very active yesterday.
