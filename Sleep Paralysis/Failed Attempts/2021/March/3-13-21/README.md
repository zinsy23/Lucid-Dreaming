# Failed Attempt

I failed today. I went to bed pretty late. I naturally woke up around 6. That's around the time I usually get deep sleep, so I wanted to wait a cycle. After waking up a cycle later, it took so much motivation to get up and check my sleep chart. I really didn't want to do that. It looked promising when I did that. There is a place where it looks like I would have had sleep paralysis, but I didn't witness it. A cycle later, I tried doing my app's timer, but when it went off, I felt like I was awake the entire time. I shut it off assuming that. According to my sleep chart, I was actually in REM around the time I remember waking up! I'm never going to jump to conclusions again, even if it takes 5 minutes to do this. I'm going to try going to bed earlier tonight. I'm not going to jump to conclusions like I did anymore. It should be considered meditation anyway even if I was wrong.
