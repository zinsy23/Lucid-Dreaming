# Failed Attempt

I failed today. I knew that I would be getting up early for what I'm doing on Thursday, which is the 10 + 10 timer for every cycle I have with melatonin and going to bed at least an hour earlier, maybe even earlier yet. I ended up deciding that I would maybe try the timer method incorporating the idea. I completely forgot to actually start it. I like to sometimes get comfortable before starting it, but I fell asleep before starting it. I did it a cycle earlier than I would have normally and went to bed not that desirably either. That could mess me up as well. I remember having a dream and realizing after waking up that I forgot to start it. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens tomorrow, especially if I do a good job with exercises and learning stuff and forming relatively unique memories for more REM (I think it increases it).
