# Failed Attempt

I failed today. I probably kept myself awake too much AFTER the timer instead of before. Once when I woke up while attempting, I got a split second pulse in my head like the buzzing during sleep paralysis itself. After waking up another time, I was hallucinating the sound of a motorcycle engine. The dream was so short and vague and then I had the hallucination just as I woke up.
