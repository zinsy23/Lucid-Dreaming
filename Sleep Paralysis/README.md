Sleep paralysis related stuff will go here.

I sometimes accidentally get sleep paralysis and I believe that is because the conditions are just right for it. I've been trying to figure out what the right conditions for that are. Stuff related to that will go here, including a program I wrote for my Fitbit to help induce sleep paralysis and my sleep charts for my successful/unsuccessful attempts.
